# Contributing

Notes:
  * This contributing.md file was largely inspired by the one in NixOS/nixpkgs project,
  * Contributing implies licensing those contributions under the terms of COPYING, which is a GNU GPLv3 license.

## Opening issues

  * Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free),
  * [Submit an issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues) - assuming one does not already exist:
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug,
    * Include all information asked by the issue template such as versions and system information,
    * Include all relevant information that may be needed to understand and reproduce the issue.

## Writing good commit messages

In addition to writing properly formatted commit messages, it's important to include relevant information so other developers can later understand *why* a change was made. While this information usually can be found by digging code, mailing list archives, pull request discussions or upstream changes, it may require a lot of work.

## Writing code

Please see `coding_in_cdpfgl.md` file in `docs` directory.
