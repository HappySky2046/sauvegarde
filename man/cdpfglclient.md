# CONFIGURATION FILE

By default the configuration file is named `/etc/cdpfgl/client.conf`. It is organised in sections [Example section]. By convention section names begins with a capital. Sections contains some key=value definitions. It is strongly recommended to modify and adapt client.conf file as it contains only example values that will not fit your needs.
